# Team 6 Project: A Better Version of When2Meet

App name: MeetU

## Team Overview

- Kushagra Srivastava (@suobset)
- James Leone (@JLeone123)
- Nhi Ha (@hacherio)


## Innovative Idea
Existing application: When2Meet (https://www.when2meet.com/), CATME
wtm: Bad UI, Hard to use on phones, cannot choose location, commenting functionality
cm: Confusing UI (can accidentally fill out the survey wrong)

We want to make a better version of a scheduling web app that overcomes these limitations, and then add some extra functionality which we believe would benefit everyone.



## Data
- Meeting title:
- Username: (email)
- Password: 
- Time selecter per user: 
- Recurrence of meeting
- Meeting location:
- Specific text boxes for Meeting agenda, roadmap, etc. Can give a markdown to end-user to define it to their liking.
- Links for Zoom/Discord/Meeting Platforms
- Links for shared Google Drive Folders, Pooled-in Resources
- A unified system for people to mention if they can make it or not on specific days (think as marking attendance...if they can typically make it but did not on a specific day, they can mention why)
- Other Comments: 



## Functionality
- Create profile with email and password.
- Create a new event
- Users can add their availabilities and vote for the location they want to meet at.
- Show times with the most overlap (color coded)

- Private/public events: e.g. Only UMass emails can schedule an event

- Set max number of members: 
- Users can add comments on the same page
- Button to send out link via email

- See all events (past/future) on a single dashboard
- Delete / create event on the dashboard

- (maybe) Google Map API: Mark locations on map
