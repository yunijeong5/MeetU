# Team 6 Project: MeetU

## Innovative Idea
Existing application: When2Meet (https://www.when2meet.com/), CATME

Their limitations are:
When2Meet-- Bad UI, hard to use on phones, cannot choose location, no commenting functionality
CATME-- Confusing UI (can accidentally fill out the survey wrong)

We want to make a scheduling web app that overcomes these limitations, and add extra functionality which we believe would benefit anyone who want to organize a group meeting. Our goal is to create an app that's simple and easy to use, but also gives intuitive UX to its users.



## Data
- Meeting title
- Username (email)
- Password 
- Time selection votes
- Recurrence of meeting
- Meeting location votes
- Comments about the meeting
- Specific text boxes for meeting agenda, roadmap, etc. Can give a markdown to end-user to define it to their liking.
- Links for Zoom/Discord/Meeting Platforms
- Links for shared Google Drive Folders, Pooled-in Resources
- A unified system for people to mention if they can make it or not on specific days (think as marking attendance...if they can typically make it but did not on a specific day, they can mention why)




## Functionality
- Create profile with email and password.
- Create a new event
- Users can add their availabilities and vote for the location they want to meet at.
- Show times with the most overlap (color coded)

- Private/public events: e.g. Only UMass emails can schedule an event

- Set max number of members: 
- Users can add comments on the same page
- Button to send out link via email

- See all events (past/future) on a single dashboard
- Delete / create event on the dashboard

- (maybe) Google Map API: Mark locations on map
